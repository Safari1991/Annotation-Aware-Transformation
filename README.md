# Preserving Provability of GPU program Optimizations

This repository contains the source code of examples in the paper "Preserving Provability of GPU program Optimizations" submitted to the Software Engineering and Formal Methods (SEFM) 2021. 

The implementation of the annotated-program optimizer, which is implemented in the VerCors verifier, is available [here](https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/tree/gpgpu-optimizations).
